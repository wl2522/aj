This Python 3 program takes an Adjuster aggregate report, which contains data for all live ad campaigns for the specified time range, and returns a copy of the report with an additional ID number column. This ID number is obtained from the ad campaign name. This column was previously produced by manually copying the ID number from each campaign name.
